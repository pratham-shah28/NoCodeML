## Project Overview

Machine learning is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into data and is used across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, implementing machine learning models usually requires in-depth programming knowledge, making it difficult for non-experts to utilize this technology. 

**No Code ML** aims to democratize machine learning and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or skill level. Our application allows users to upload their datasets and apply machine learning models easily through an intuitive, browser-based interface. 

## Features

- **No Coding Required**: Perform machine learning tasks without writing a single line of code.
- **Web-Based Application**: No installation is needed. Accessible via any device with an internet connection.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design makes it easy for users to upload data and apply machine learning models.
- **Wide Range of Models**: Includes various machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles data inconsistencies like missing values and applies transformations like label encoding and scaling.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Data**: Users can easily upload their datasets in a supported format (e.g., CSV).
2. **Select Model**: From a dropdown menu, users can select a machine learning model they want to apply (e.g., regression, classification, or clustering).
3. **Configure Variables**: Specify independent and dependent variables for the model.
4. **Train the Model**: The application processes the dataset and trains the selected machine learning model.
5. **View Results**: Users can view the model's results and visualizations directly within the application.
6. **Download Model**: After training, the model can be downloaded for further use.

## Models Supported

No Code ML supports a wide range of machine learning models, including:

- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Clustering Models**: K-Means Clustering

## Data Preprocessing

No Code ML includes a robust data preprocessing module designed to clean and prepare the data before applying machine learning models. The preprocessing features include:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Automatically imputes missing values.
- **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into numerical values.
- **Scaling**: Normalizes numerical data to improve model performance.
- **Default Data Cleaning**: Automatically applies standard cleaning steps to improve the consistency of the dataset.

## Installation

No installation is required, as No Code ML is a fully web-based application. Users can access it directly through their internet browser.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the **No Code ML** application.
2. Upload your dataset in CSV format.
3. Select the machine learning model you want to use from the dropdown menu.
4. Specify the independent and dependent variables.
5. Click "Train Model" to apply the model to your data.
6. View and download the results, including model predictions and visualizations.
